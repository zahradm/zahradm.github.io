## Hi!

I'm Zahra! A software engineer who writes Python by day and explores random rabbit holes by night.

I'm big on open source, always learning something new, and I believe the best code is the code you don't have to explain twice.

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me reading, tinkering with a side project, or going down a Wikipedia spiral.

Say hi on the [contact](/contact/) page or check out what I've been writing on the [blog](/blog/)!
